## Crypto-economy for science & innovation.

### Blockchain for Science

To the Moon, Mars, and beyondðŸš€

**Own the World's most influential bits of science that advance humanity!** Scientific publications are _memes_.

Here we kickstart the [crypto-economy for science](https://medium.com/blockchainforscience/the-emerging-crypteconomy-for-science-and-knowledge-creation-6cfe2a79f514). As bitcoin and blockchain have incentivized the ones who can think beyond the status quo, we feel that science needs more of this.

We create a [NFT standard for scientific papers, ideas, concepts, data sets, and all that advances science](https://twitter.com/soenkeba/status/1370330762801733637), mint it, and get the narrative up and running.

Revenue created will go to the decentralized future of science and/or might end up in a research-DAO.
