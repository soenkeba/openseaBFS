## Blockchain for Science - Crypto-economy for science & innovation.

To the Moon, Mars, and beyondðŸš€

Own the World's most influential bits of science that advance humanity! Scientific publications are memes.

Here we kickstart the crypto-economy for science and research. As bitcoin and blockchain have incentivized the ones who can think beyond the status quo, we feel that science needs more of this.

We create a standard for scientific papers, ideas, concepts, data sets, and all that advances science, mint it, and get the narrative up and running (and fellow people to understand how to use blockchain, â€¦).

Revenue created will go to the decentralized future of science and will be used to continue to kickstart the crypto-economy for science.
